History Editor lets you view (and edit!) all your history easily.
History Editor can:
- display all your history events
- mark any item (un)read
- edit the text in a message?!!
- export the message to XML or text
- remove all history from individual contacts
- delete individual history items

REMEMBER TO USE DBTOOL AFTER MAKING CHANGES TO MINIMISE WASTED SPACE
